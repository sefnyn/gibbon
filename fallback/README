This directory contains fallback files for possibly missing build tools.
If autogen.sh finds that a certain command is not installed it copies
the files from the corresponding fallback directory instead.

If this happens, your build is maybe incomplete or even broken.  You have
to check that yourself!  Sometimes, configuring with the right options
will heal that problem.  For example if you don't have gtkdocize then
you should not call configure with --enable-gtk-doc.

As a rule of thumb, if any build tool is missing or failed, you should
not create a distribution leave alone publish it.

The files in the fallback directories come from the following versions:

- glib-gettextize (GNU glib) 2.26.1
- gnome-doc-common (gnome-common) 2.28.0
- gnome-doc-preparee (GNU gnome-doc-utils) 0.20.4
- gtkdocize (gtk-doc) 1.16
- intltoolize (GNU intltool) 0.41.1

If one of the above mentioned packages is not recent enough the files
in here must be updated!
